## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

The hardest part for me by far was the parse_packaging function. After struggling with assigning things to dictionaries within a single for() loop I decided to extract the sections of each line into two lists, one with values, the other with item names. The tricky things was that with each entry the items would build on eachother so it was necessary to skip items in favor of the plural versions of them. I refamiliarized myself with the in range() function and setting increment values within the loop. I also used % and len() in conjunction with eachother to perform additional action on even numbered packaging steps. I am less familiar with those ideas so I am proud of deciding to use them all by myself (no chatGPT). After that everything else came fairly easily, I did need to learn how to use the values() and keys() function with dictionaries in order to complete the other two custom functions in packaging.py. I did need to look up how to read from .txt and writing to JSON. I wasn't sure what to export to JSON so I wrote the parsed packages. I think I had a good mix of trial and error by attempting the problem myself and then using resources like ChatGPT to give me a new perspective or by troubleshooting annoying bugs/syntax. At one point I had to troubleshoot a problem myself when "bins" was being separated by my strsplit() function. I may have benefited from referring directly to informational websites on how to do things like to write to json or the range() function, because while I understand it, there is likely other features I would have learned about that I simply did get exposed to through using ChatGPT. Then again, this assignment was hard enough already.
